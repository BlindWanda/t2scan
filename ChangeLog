 - creating first release. The differences between t2scan and w_scan are:
    - Simplified scanning: The scan happens in one run and the NIT is only used
      to get the parameters of the *current* channel. This design decision was
      made since I noticed that often the NIT data referring to other channels
      is not reliable for DVB-T/T2, leading to channels not being found or
      having wrong IDs resulting in a non-working EPG in vdr. The approach
      should work with most current DVB-T/T2 cards since they can autodetect
      most parameters of a transponder when tuning. For DVB-S, this approach 
      would result in many channels not being found, therefore I removed DVB-S
      (and -C) support.
   - Added a parameter to determing the DVB-T type for scan ("-t1" for DVB-T
     only, "-t2" for DVB-T2 only). This makes the scan much faster if the user
     knows that only one DVB-T type is used in the user's region. The option
     for the tuning speed ("-t" in w_scan) has been changed to "-s".
   - Added a parameter to determine the lowest channel to scan ("-k") and the
     highest channel to scan ("-K"). This makes the scan much faster if the
     user knows which channels are used in the user's region.
   - Only DVB-T/T2 (ATSC available, but untested), support for DVB-C and
     DVB-S/S2 has been removed.
   - Removed several options, trying to keep this tool very simple.

 - start work on initial version using wirbel's w_scan, simplifying it, and
   removing sat support
